# Minecraft Classic

A version of Minecraft that no one remembers—and Mojang won’t comment on.
It was found in a storage shed that had recently been the target of an arson attack.
We don’t know why the shed was targeted, but in the ashes, we found the old game, completely untouched by the fire.
A miracle, really, because if it had been even slightly burned, it wouldn’t have worked at all.

We don’t know what device it was originally meant to run on, as it wouldn’t work on anything we tried.
That’s when a friend of mine, Nexy, managed to port a semi-working version to PC using Forge, some mods, and a lot of coding.

She even mentioned she might be able to recover more data and possibly port mods to it in the future.

I’ve played it a bit now, and let’s just say—it’s not normal. Unfortunately, if you want to know more, you’ll have to play it yourself.
So, I present to you: Minecraft Classic.
